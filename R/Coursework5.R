#' ### Question 1
#'Use the data of child height/weight and study them using qq-plots in a specific age and gender at a time.
#'Compare heights of underweight and very overweight children
#'Compare one of the attributes (height, weight, BMI)
#'between boys and girls (select either younger or older age group) to each other.

#

#'### Question 2
#'Fix the age (look only at one specific age – of exactly the same nr of months).
#' Compare the distribution of height vs BMI using two qq-plots – one for boys, 
#' one for girls. (Hopefully different students will pick different age for this)

#' ### Question 3
#' Compare the height of overweight children against theoretical normal distribution. 
#' You can limit to certain age group and gender.
